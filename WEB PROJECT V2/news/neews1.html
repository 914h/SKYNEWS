            Vinícius Júnior has called La Liga and Spain racist after Real Madrid’s Brazil forward received racial
            slurs from the stands in Sunday’s defeat at Valencia’s Mestalla stadium. Vinícius Júnior pointed out the
            fans who were insulting him, leading to the match being stopped for 10 minutes, and then got into an
            altercation with Valencia’s players which led to his sending-off in added time. “It was not the first
            time, nor the second, nor the third. Racism is normal in La Liga. The competition considers it normal,
            the federation considers it normal and the rivals encourage it,” Vinicius posted on Twitter after the
            game. “The championship that once belonged to Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Cristiano and Messi today belongs to
            the racists.
